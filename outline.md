# Player Class

A **player's** goal is to maximize their number of **victory points** by the end of the **game**.
To do so, each **player** uses their **deck** to perform **actions** and buy **cards** from **decks**
Each **turn** a **player** uses the **cards** in their **hand** in two **phases**:
  - An **action** phase
  - A **buying** phase
